# Canon Rules — Helix72 v1

These rules define what qualifies as canonical within the Helix72 system. They
govern authorship, structure, interpretation, and future evolution of the canon.
All rules are enforced by the sole maintainer.

---

## 1. Authorship Rules

### Rule 1.1 — Single Author Canon
All canonical content must be authored exclusively by:
**Denny Michael LaFountaine**  
for **Quantum Labs Research & Development LLC**.

### Rule 1.2 — No External Canon
No external contributions, reinterpretations, or derivative proposals may be
considered canonical.

---

## 2. Structural Rules

### Rule 2.1 — Fixed Architecture
The Helix72 architecture (axial index, domains, σ‑field, Laplacian, invariants)
is fixed and cannot be altered except by the sole maintainer.

### Rule 2.2 — Deterministic Mapping Chain
The mapping chain:
Role → Relation → Torsion → Stability → σ-field
must remain intact and unmodified.

### Rule 2.3 — UISL2 Encoding Requirement
All canonical structures must be represented in a strict‑mode UISL2 capsule.

---

## 3. Interpretation Rules

### Rule 3.1 — No Reinterpretation
Canonical definitions may not be reinterpreted, reframed, or extended by
external parties.

### Rule 3.2 — No Speculative Extensions
Speculative additions, hypothetical variants, or alternative mappings are not
canon unless authored by the maintainer.

### Rule 3.3 — Canon Precedence
If a conflict arises between:
- documentation  
- diagrams  
- commentary  
- external discussion  

the UISL2 capsule takes precedence.

---

## 4. Evolution Rules

### Rule 4.1 — Versioned Canon
All canonical changes must be released as versioned updates:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

### Rule 4.2 — Backward Compatibility
Minor versions must remain compatible with v1 unless explicitly deprecated.

### Rule 4.3 — Deprecation Authority
Only the sole maintainer may deprecate:
- invariants  
- operators  
- mappings  
- structural components  

---

## 5. Protection Rules

### Rule 5.1 — No Fork Canonization
Forks, mirrors, or external repositories cannot contain canonical updates.

### Rule 5.2 — No Community Governance
Helix72 does not use community voting, committees, or collaborative governance.

### Rule 5.3 — Canon Integrity
Any deviation from:
- invariants  
- validation rules  
- UISL2 structure  
- mapping chain  

results in **NON_CANON** status.

---

## 6. Summary

The canon rules ensure:
- authorship purity  
- structural determinism  
- interpretive consistency  
- protection from drift  
- long‑term stability of the Helix72 architecture  

Only the sole maintainer defines canon.
