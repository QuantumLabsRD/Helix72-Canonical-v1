# Novelty Statement — Helix72 v1

Helix72 v1 introduces original scientific structure beyond the patented ARYN’s Ladder
system. The following elements constitute **novel, non‑derivative contributions** authored
by **Denny Michael LaFountaine** and protected under the Helix72 v1 canonical release:

## 1. Axial Stability Field (σ-field)
A deterministic stability field defined by:
- torsion–stability coupling
- integer‑valued stability scoring
- global σ-range invariants
- discrete Laplacian curvature analysis

This field does not appear in ARYN’s Ladder and is unique to Helix72.

## 2. Curvature Localization Lemma
A new lemma establishing curvature presence based on local σ‑triplet inequality.
This is an original mathematical contribution.

## 3. Total Curvature Invariant (K = 45)
A global invariant derived from the σ‑field and Laplacian operator.
This invariant is not part of Ladder72 and is unique to Helix72 v1.

## 4. Deterministic Mapping Chain
The formal chain:
Ladder72 Role → Relation → Torsion → Stability → σ-field
This mapping sequence and its computational determinism are novel.

## 5. UISL2 Canon Capsule for Helix72
The strict‑mode UISL2 representation of Helix72 v1 is an original encoding authored
specifically for this release.

## Summary
Helix72 v1 is a derivative extension of ARYN’s Ladder but contains **substantial new
mathematical structure**, **new invariants**, and **new computational rules** that are
entirely original to this work.

These elements constitute the novelty basis for future filings, continuations, and
scientific expansion.
