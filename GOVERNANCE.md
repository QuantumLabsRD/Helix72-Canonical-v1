# Governance — Helix72 v1

Helix72 v1 is a canonical scientific artifact governed exclusively by  
**Denny Michael LaFountaine**  
and **Quantum Labs Research & Development LLC**.

This document defines the governance model for all canonical updates, revisions,
and derivative releases.

---

## 1. Authority

### 1.1 Sole Maintainer
All canonical decisions, updates, and structural changes are made solely by:

**Denny Michael LaFountaine  
Founder & Anatomical Polymath  
Quantum Labs Research & Development LLC**

No other individual or organization holds authority over this canon.

### 1.2 No Community Governance
This repository does **not** use:
- community voting  
- maintainers’ councils  
- open governance models  
- contributor committees  

Helix72 is not an open‑source project.

## 2. Canon Update Rules

### 2.1 Canon Integrity
All updates must:
- preserve the deterministic structure  
- maintain UISL2 strict‑mode compatibility  
- respect the patented ARYN’s Ladder lineage  
- avoid drift, reinterpretation, or speculative extensions  

### 2.2 Versioning
Canonical versions follow:
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Example:
1.0.0 → 1.1.0 → 2.0.0

### 2.3 Release Requirements
A new canonical version requires:
- updated UISL2 capsule  
- updated Markdown documentation  
- updated CHANGELOG  
- updated VERSION file  
- updated Zenodo DOI (if applicable)

## 3. External Input

### 3.1 No External Contributions
Pull requests, issues, and forks do not influence canon.

### 3.2 Collaboration
Collaboration occurs **only** through direct communication with  
Quantum Labs Research & Development LLC.

No GitHub‑based collaboration is permitted.

## 4. Canon Expansion

### 4.1 Derivative Modules
Future modules (e.g., Helix72 v2, Helix144, or related frameworks) must:
- be authored by the sole maintainer  
- follow the same governance rules  
- maintain compatibility with UISL2 or successor schema  

### 4.2 Deprecation
Only the sole maintainer may deprecate:
- mappings  
- invariants  
- operators  
- structural components  

---

## 5. Summary
Helix72 v1 is governed under a strict, single‑maintainer model ensuring:
- canonical purity  
- deterministic evolution  
- protection of intellectual property  
- alignment with the patented ARYN’s Ladder system  

All authority resides with the author.
