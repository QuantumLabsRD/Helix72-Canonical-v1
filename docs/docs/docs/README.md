# Helix72 Documentation Index

This directory contains extended documentation for the Helix72 v1 canonical
release. All documents in this folder expand upon the core files in the root
repository and provide deeper explanations, diagrams, and reference material.

Only the sole maintainer may add, modify, or remove documentation.

## Contents

### 1. Architecture
High‑level structural explanations, diagrams, and system overviews.

### 2. Invariants & Validation
Detailed breakdowns of:
- canonical invariants  
- validator logic  
- UISL2 interpretation rules  

### 3. Mathematical Notes
Supplemental derivations, proofs, and commentary that support the Helix72
framework without altering the canonical structure.

### 4. Future Extensions
Reserved space for:
- Helix72 v2 documentation  
- multi‑axis expansions  
- cross‑system integration notes  

---

## Canon Integrity

All documents in this directory must:
- preserve the deterministic structure of Helix72  
- remain consistent with the UISL2 capsule  
- avoid reinterpretation or speculative extensions  

If a conflict arises, the UISL2 capsule takes precedence.

## Status

This folder is initialized for future canonical documentation.
