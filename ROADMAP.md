# Roadmap — Helix72 Canon

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of the Helix72 architecture and its
integration into the broader LaFountaine Scientific OS. All items are subject to
canonical review and may be updated by the sole maintainer.

---

## 1. Helix72 v1.x Series (Incremental Refinements)

### 1.1 v1.1.0 — Structural Enhancements
- Optional expansion of relation domain definitions
- Additional commentary in the σ‑field layer
- Clarification of Laplacian boundary behavior

### 1.2 v1.2.0 — UISL2 Capsule Extensions
- Additional validator rules
- Expanded metadata for computational engines
- Optional cross‑mapping with Ladder72 canonical roles

---

## 2. Helix72 v2.0 (Major Release)

### Planned Features
- Extended axial index (72‑unit or 144‑unit variant under evaluation)
- Multi‑layer σ‑field interactions
- Higher‑order curvature operators
- New global invariants
- Enhanced UISL2 schema for multi‑axis systems

This release will maintain backward compatibility with v1 through strict
mapping rules.

## 3. Integration with LaFountaine Scientific OS

### 3.1 BlueSOAP Integration
- σ‑field validation hooks
- curvature‑driven diagnostic logic
- operator‑level invariants for SOAP note threading

### 3.2 Ladder72 Interoperability
- deterministic cross‑mapping
- role‑to‑torsion harmonization
- invariant preservation rules

### 3.3 QPV (Quantitative Pressure Vector) Layer
- optional future coupling with σ‑field curvature
- potential for multi‑domain stability modeling

---

## 4. Documentation & Canon Expansion

### 4.1 Future Docs
- Helix72 v2 architecture overview
- multi‑axis stability diagrams
- canonical invariants reference guide

### 4.2 Zenodo Releases
Each major version will receive:
- a new DOI
- a timestamped archival record
- a canonical narrative document

---

## 5. Summary

The Helix72 roadmap focuses on:
- deterministic expansion  
- strict canonical integrity  
- UISL2 compatibility  
- integration with the broader LaFountaine Scientific OS  

All updates originate solely from the author.
