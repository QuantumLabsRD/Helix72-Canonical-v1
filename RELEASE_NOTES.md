# Release Notes — Helix72 v1 (1.0.0)

Helix72 v1 represents the first public canonical release of the Helix72 axial
stability framework. This version establishes the foundational architecture,
mathematical structure, and UISL2 encoding that future versions will build upon.

---

## Overview

Helix72 v1 introduces a deterministic 36‑unit axial model derived from the
patented ARYN’s Ladder system. This release formalizes:

- the σ‑field stability architecture  
- the discrete Laplacian curvature layer  
- the global curvature invariant (K = 45)  
- the relation–torsion–stability mapping chain  
- the strict UISL2 capsule for machine‑readable validation  

This version is the authoritative baseline for all future Helix72 expansions.

## Key Features

### 1. Deterministic Axial Structure
A fixed 36‑index axis with phase, relation, torsion, stability, and σ‑field
values defined without ambiguity.

### 2. σ‑Field Definition
A novel stability field:
σᵢ = τᵢ + 2 × s(Sᵢ)
with global bounds:
−4 ≤ σᵢ ≤ +7

### 3. Curvature Analysis Layer
A discrete Laplacian operator enabling:
- curvature localization  
- global invariant computation  
- structural stability analysis  

### 4. Global Invariant (K = 45)
A unique curvature invariant derived from the σ‑field.

### 5. UISL2 Canon Capsule
A strict‑mode UISL2 file encoding the entire Helix72 v1 structure for:
- deterministic reconstruction  
- validator enforcement  
- computational interpretation

## Purpose of This Release

This release serves to:
- establish the canonical baseline for Helix72  
- provide a timestamped, DOI‑linked scientific artifact  
- enable future expansions (v1.x and v2.x)  
- integrate with the broader LaFountaine Scientific OS  

---

## Compatibility

Helix72 v1 is fully compatible with:
- ARYN’s Ladder (patented)  
- UISL2 schema  
- future Helix72 versions  

Backward compatibility will be maintained for all v1.x updates.

---

## Status

**Helix72 v1 is declared ACTIVE_CANON.**

This version is complete, stable, and ready for academic, computational, and
archival use.
